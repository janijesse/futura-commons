# 🧠 Futura Commons – Onchain Retirement Fund

Category: DeFi / Regenerative Finance / Tokenized Savings  
Hackathon Track: XRPL Commons

---

## 🚀 The Big Idea

Futura Commons is a decentralized financial system that reimagines retirement and long-term savings through a regenerative lens. Instead of locking funds into opaque institutions, users contribute value into transparent, verifiable, and composable on-chain liquidity pools that fuel regenerative economies.

We leverage XRPL’s upcoming Automated Market Maker (AMM) technology to create a next-gen community savings vehicle — backed by a token called RETREAT, and powered by on-chain liquidity dynamics.

## 💼 Business Model

### 💡 The Problem

Traditional pension systems are:

- ❌ Centralized, outdated, and misaligned with individual values  
- ❌ Exclude freelancers, gig workers, or people in the Global South — especially those paid in tokens  
- ❌ Not transparent, difficult to access, and provide no regenerative or social impact  

---

## 🌱 RETREAT's Solution

- 🌐 Users mint or receive RETREAT tokens — their “pension points”
- 💧 These tokens are pooled into XRPL AMMs with real liquidity (XRP)
- 🌍 Liquidity can support green projects, regenerative NFTs, or tokenized real-world assets *(MVP uses XRP only)*
- 📈 Participants earn passive yield + social impact reputation
- 🔁 Value is recoverable, tradable, or re-deployable — retirement with flexibility + meaning

## ⚙️ Technical Breakdown

| Component           | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| XRPL Devnet / AMM Devnet | Base protocol to issue tokens, create trustlines, and launch AMM               |
| RETREAT Token          | ASCII-based custom token (20-character HEX padded) representing long-term savings |
| Two Wallets (Issuer & LP) | Simulates user and protocol behavior: Issuer distributes RETREAT, LP provides liquidity |
| TrustSet + Payment TXs | Establish token trustline and handle transfers securely                         |
| AMMCreate TX           | Creates a liquidity pool with 20 RETREAT + 40 XRP                             |
| Custom AMM Monitor     | Validates pool creation and monitors status using XRPL APIs                     |

> 🪙 RETREAT is issued in standardized XRPL format — lightweight, fee-efficient, and compatible with wallets and aggregators.

## 🌍 Impact Potential

- 👩‍💻 Freelancers & DAOs can self-organize retirement plans, backed by communities  
- 🌱 Regenerative projects can plug in as yield sources  
- 🏘 NGOs & local communities gain programmable, transparent saving mechanisms

---

## 🧪 Hackathon Deliverables

- ✅ Fully working JavaScript/Node.js script  
- ✅ RETREAT Token issued and pooled via XRPL AMM  
- ✅ Dynamic autofill() logic, robust validation, and AMM status monitoring  
- 🔜 Web interface to simulate real contributions  
- 🔜 Farcaster Frames integration for community voting on pool allocations

---

## 🛠 Stack Used

- [xrpl.js](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl.js) — Full control over transaction lifecycle and signing  
- XRPL Devnet — For all token logic and AMM simulation  
- Node.js / CLI-first — Transparent, traceable development workflow

---

## 🔄 What Happens Next

Once AMMs go live on XRPL Mainnet:

- ✅ Enable real contributions to RETREAT pools  
- 🌉 Connect to RWA bridges or climate-positive protocols (e.g., CELO)

---

## 🙌 Why It Matters

We're bridging financial self-sovereignty with planet-positive savings.

RETREAT isn’t just another DeFi experiment — it’s a modular, regenerative retirement layer on XRPL that enables people to:

- Save meaningfully  
- Grow wealth securely  
- Fund the future they want to retire into
