### Futura Commons

A decentralized retirement platform built on the XRPL blockchain, providing a transparent and regenerative approach to pension funds.

## Overview

Futura Commons is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to create and manage their retirement funds on the XRPL blockchain. The platform converts user deposits into the project's native token, which is then allocated to yield-generating pools to grow users' pensions over time. AI Agents handle the NFT minting and authorization verification processes.

## Key Features

- **Risk Assessment**: Personalized risk profiling based on age, country, income, and investment experience
- **Pension Simulator**: Interactive tool to estimate future pension value based on contributions and yield rates
- **Wallet Integration**: Seamless connection with XRPL wallets for secure transactions
- **Token Conversion**: Automatic conversion of deposited XRP to Futura Commons tokens
- **AI-Powered NFT Authorization**: AI Agents mint access NFTs and verify wallet authorization
- **Impact Tracking**: Monitor both financial growth and positive environmental impact of investments
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for both desktop and mobile devices


## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library
- **Blockchain**: XRPL (XRP Ledger)
- **Authentication**: NFT-based access control managed by AI Agents
- **State Management**: Local storage (MVP version)


## How It Works

1. **Assessment**: Users complete a risk assessment form to determine their investment profile
2. **Pension Planning**: Users simulate their pension growth using the interactive yield calculator
3. **Contribution**: Users connect their XRPL wallet and make their initial contribution
4. **Token Conversion**: Deposited XRP is converted to Futura Commons tokens
5. **AI-Powered NFT Minting**: An AI Agent mints a unique NFT to the user's wallet, serving as their access key
6. **Yield Generation**: Tokens are allocated to yield-generating pools based on the user's risk profile
7. **Vault Access**: When accessing the pension vault, an AI Agent verifies the wallet has the required authorization NFT
8. **Dashboard Access**: Users can track their pension growth and impact metrics after verification


## AI Agent Authorization System

Futura Commons implements a secure access control system using AI Agents:

- **NFT Minting Agent**: Automatically mints unique authorization NFTs to user wallets upon initial contribution
- **Verification Agent**: Checks for the presence of the authorization NFT when users attempt to access their pension vault
- **Security Monitoring**: Continuously monitors for unauthorized access attempts
- **Revocation Handling**: Manages NFT revocation in case of security concerns


## User Flow

1. **Landing Page**: Introduction to the platform and its benefits
2. **Assessment**: Complete personal information and risk tolerance questionnaire
3. **Pension Simulator**: Adjust contribution amounts and view projected pension values
4. **Contribution**: Connect wallet and make initial contribution
5. **NFT Minting**: AI Agent mints authorization NFT to the user's wallet
6. **Success**: Receive confirmation of contribution and NFT minting
7. **Dashboard**: Access personalized dashboard after AI Agent verifies NFT authorization


## Regenerative Finance

Futura Commons implements regenerative finance principles by:

- Allocating funds to sustainable projects that generate both financial returns and positive impact
- Tracking carbon offset and renewable energy metrics for each investment
- Supporting projects like solar microgrids and sustainable agriculture


## Security Features

- Self-custodial solution where users maintain control of their assets
- AI-powered NFT-based access control for dashboard and pension management
- Transparent allocation of funds visible on the XRPL blockchain
- Secure verification process for all vault access attempts


## Future Development

- Multi-currency support
- Enhanced AI verification capabilities
- Mobile application
- Governance mechanisms for community-driven decision making
- Integration with additional yield-generating protocols
- Advanced NFT features for tiered access and benefits
